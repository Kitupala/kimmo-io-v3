## kimmo.io — Personal Portfolio
### ✦ Overview

My personal portfolio and creative playground — designed, built, and animated from the ground up with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, GSAP, and Prismic.
It blends thoughtful motion with smooth scrolling, subtle 3D details, and a content-driven architecture that keeps it easy to evolve over time.
